SO before all this LTE nonsense there was 3G(idfk) but it was based on HSPA(high speed packet Access)(this is the death of DSL):
    Which DSL is basically fixed network connections like landlines or AOL. Game change when Data packets could transfer from mobile phone to mobile fone

2G came out during Clinton-Era 
we didnt get videos until the end of Dubba First term(3G):
    problem with 3Gwhen it first came out and also the main problem with 2G was the data transfer limitations So you just couldnt,
    do Multimedia transfer. Also delay of data transmission(things were analong, those two Goats I mentions pushed for wireless. WooPiG...Go COUGARS) 
LTE fuck tha game up. Sum Bama(No roll tide) shit
