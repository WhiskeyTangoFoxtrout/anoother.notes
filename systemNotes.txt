#*Errthang is based on BitI/O gotta remember that
everthing is a bit jus with a diffrent repersentation, whole new abstract it might even be a color


*#

'Buses':
    -are eletrical conduits
    -they carry bytes to/from componets, perphials
    -mainly designed for word#*words aew fixed sized chunks of byes not the whole mayb thats y its 4 bytes
    this is a fundemtal parameter that varies across systems*#

'I/O devices':
    -think perphials, yo keyboard#disk drives count too
    -Each device is connect thru an adapta/controlla:
        +'adapta'::is a card with a plugin/'controlla'::are chip encoded and usally embedded

'Main Memory':
    -temp storage disk:
        +hold program and data
    -'DRAM'(Dynamic Random Access Memroy):
        +Physically main mem
    -Logically memory is a linary array of bytes:
        +this acts as an address and we run it, like so
        +it usually starts in 0#*fun fact your O.S Bootloader usaslly is the last mem address and I think we work backwards*#
#*REMINDER ------------------------------------------------------------

            Use the recursive formula in your O.S so you dont bufferoverflw this isnt pre 1970

*#

'Processor':
    -Usally 'CPU':
        +interpts Instructs
        +regs are a fuckin word size 4 or 8 bytes#wtf THIS IS WHY KNOW THE WORD OF GOD SO IMPORRTSNT
        #also regs are like a stroage or VRAM or the procsesor
        #also called the program counter PC reading the ASM docs make a lil mo sense
        +if I get it right chip mem is erased after each power down#Vram
