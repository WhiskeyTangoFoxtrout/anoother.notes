*Trick wit sockets is you need to transfer data:
    -think 'read()'/'write()'/'send()'/'recv()'/'alloc()'/'memcpy()'...etc
*socket is repr by an int(this is the socketitdescriptor):
    -think internet protocol nums
    -as long as the 'conn()'/'accept()'/'listen()' open the sockit open
    -can make custom sockets that comm with IBM or that berkly research non-sense #WOOPIG
    -sockets is whats really movn data around
*connection sockets:
    -implies the machine are already talkin#thinkin mo ether net in mind
*connectionless::think the internet
*so sockets need an memaddr loc bc its an program that will hold mem::its not an ip hopefully
*ip4::use 32-bits 
*ip6::use 128 bits
