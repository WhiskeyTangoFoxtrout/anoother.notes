#*Cnotes once again*#
'Numerical Limits':
    -limits.h/float.h/stdint.h are for numerical limits

'Inception Limits':3this is the limits of a program if I get it right. SO C SIZE LIMIT
    -127 nesting lvl of blocks
    -63 nesting lvl of conditional inclusion(statments)
    -12 pointers,arrays, and func dec of any combo used to mod an arth, struct, union or void type declaration
    -63 nesting lvls of parenthesized dec with full dec
    -63 nesting lvls of parenthesized expression within a full expression
    -63 significant init char in an internal identifier.(so car names ony 16bit)
    -31 sig init char in an internal indentfier(short)
    -4095 external indenifier in one translation unit
    -511 identifiers in  one block(not to many vars now)
    -4095 macro name simulanenously defind in one preprocessing tranlating unit
    -127 parameters in one function def
    -127 parameters in one macro
    -127 args in one marco invocation
    -4095 characters in a logic srcln basically this is the col limit
    -4095 chars in str lit after concatenation... adding strs together
    -65535 bytes in an obj
    -15 nesting lvl 4 #include flies
    -1023 case labels for a switch statements 
    -1023 enums const in a single enum
    -63 lvls of nested of structure or union def in a single struc dec list

functions can be interupted by an signal or interuption#*I hate asm refer to your chip documentation*#
#*
there is a couple of ways to do display semantics
*#
'char display semantics':
    -'\a'(alert)::audio or visible alert without changing position;
    -'\f'(form feed):: movs the active pos 2da init pos @ start to nxt logical page
    -'\r'(carriage return)::movs da active pos 2da init pos of da current ln
    -others:
        +'\b'
        +'\v'
        +'\t'
        +'\n'
there is diffrent forms of floating points

#*Should mention, you need 'fputc'(which is some type output function that displays to the monitor)
and isprint(same as fputc but with subtle diffrences)*#
'floating C':    
#this thang gave the formula for Floating points but its almost like unsigned to two compliment just diffrent variable factors also its in a range just like unsigned to twos compliment
#I dont feel like writting it down so refer to google
