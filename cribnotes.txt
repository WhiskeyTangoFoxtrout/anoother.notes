static:
    Default value. Elements render in order, as they appear in the document flow	
absolute:
    The element is positioned relative to its first positioned (not static) ancestor element	
fixed:
    The element is positioned relative to the browser window	
relative: 
    The element is positioned relative to its normal position, so "left:20px" adds 20 pixels to the element's LEFT position	
sticky:
    The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position
A sticky
     element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).

Note: Not supported in IE/Edge 15 or earlier. Supported in Safari from version 6.1 with a -webkit- prefix.	
initial:
    Sets this property to its default value. Read about initial
