#need this so I can write the ya digs out
-address(uint160(byte20(address))) or address(uint160(uint256(b))) is used to convert any address larger than 20 bytes to fit the meta
    one if for bytes other is for bits

*******************Socket pro*********************

when you are trying to wirte data out tie it to the array or what ever bit/byte output that will write to another machine
#im working on header make ima assume on the echo its gotta be less than 8 bits and erthangelse gone wit the law of two:
    conn.Write(msg[0:len]) this would write and send message in Go
header should only be ness, addy, os, des machine info
